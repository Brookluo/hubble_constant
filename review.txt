1. It is unclear to me what the velocity reference frame is.

I added a paragraph in section 3 to discuss the velocity reference frame, and 
how the velocity was calculated. I also discussed the reason for choosing the
heliocentric velocity. 

2. I think throwing out the very close objects isn't warranted here.  
    With peculiar velocities of ~600 km/s much of your sample has similar (if not larger) problems.  
    What you're finding, I think, is that there are large scale flows for structures larger/farther away than the local group.  
    And there are. 




3. It is good to look at outliers.  
    In big catalogs outliers are often objects with bad measurements.  
    You do need to check, of course, as real outliers may be of special physical interest.



4. There are many small errors and typos (e.g., "comic" instead of "cosmic").

Thank you for your feedback. This has been addressed. I also used spell-checking tool
to ensure small typos should have been fixed. 

5. Your uncertainty seems very small given the data set.  
    You might try other ways of estimating the uncertainty.

6. Your fitting algorithm is not clear.  
    There are several OLS fitting algorithms.
